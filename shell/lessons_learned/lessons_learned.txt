This is without receiveing feedback from the class 

1. useful to a advanced beginner (these are PhD students not School kids !!!)
2. useful to an advanced scripter - additional resources and advanced excercises included
3. (probably most important) has a motivating scientific example - cover data collection, data staging, analysis, results, (maybe something on referincing or how shell can help)
4. Cheat sheet could just be an intro / cover background for the advanced user - anyway please see the lessons_learned/lessons_learned.txt for more info

I think asking them before if they 


1) know what the shell is
2) have used it before
3) can write scripts

Would be useful questions.

The group was good at shell scripting - 50% and 50% not

I think some topics needed covering which were not:

stdin
stdout
stderr

I also think

;'s and `` in the shell was worth covering

also was suprised that the material did not cover the enviroment specicially setting variable and then using the $PATH as an example (I would cover the subtlty beween export and none-export


Also not sure if the notes are meant to be standalone but worth looknig around for other tutorials  - e.g. job control


But overall need to tie into a scientific investigation much more - a workflow if you like.

i.e.

Data collection
Data staging
analysis
results
(conclusions for another time - I mean how does the shell help with this - not sure ?)
