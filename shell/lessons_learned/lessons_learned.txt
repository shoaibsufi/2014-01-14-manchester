This is without receiveing feedback from the class 

I think asking them before if they 


1) know what the shell is
2) have used it before
3) can write scripts

Would be useful questions.

The group was good at shell scripting - 50% and 50% not

I think some topics needed covering which were not:

stdin
stdout
stderr

I also think

;'s and `` in the shell was worth covering

also was suprised that the material did not cover the enviroment specicially setting variable and then using the $PATH as an example (I would cover the subtlty beween export and none-export


Also not sure if the notes are meant to be standalone but worth looknig around for other tutorials  - e.g. job control


But overall need to tie into a scientific investigation much more - a workflow if you like.

i.e.

Data collection
Data staging
analysis
results
(conclusions for another time - I mean how does the shell help with this - not sure ?)
